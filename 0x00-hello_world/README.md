Python - Hello, World
This directory contains Python scripts and a C function for various programming tasks. Each task is designed to help you practice and develop your Python programming skills.

Key Components
Python Scripts: The directory includes Python scripts that cover different aspects of Python, such as printing, string manipulation, and more.

C Function: The C function, 10-check_cycle.c, checks for cycles in a linked list.

Helper Files: You'll find linked_lists.c and lists.h for testing the C function.

Tasks
Run Python File: A Bash script (0-run) that runs a Python script stored in the environment variable $PYFILE.

Run Inline: A Bash script (1-run_inline) that runs Python code stored in the environment variable $PYCODE.

Hello, print: A Python script (2-print.py) that prints a specific message using the print function.

Print integer: A Python script (3-print_number.py) for printing an integer and a message.

Print float: A Python script (4-print_float.py) for printing a float with a specified precision.

Print string: A Python script (5-print_string.py) for printing a string multiple times and extracting characters.

Play with strings: A Python script (6-concat.py) that combines strings to create a message.

Copy - Cut - Paste: A Python script (7-edges.py) that manipulates a string by copying, cutting, and pasting.

Create a new sentence: A Python script (8-concat_edges.py) for creating a new sentence.

Easter Egg: A Python script (9-easter_egg.py) that prints a famous Python quote.

Linked list cycle: A C function (10-check_cycle.c) for detecting cycles in a linked list.

Hello, write: A Python script (100-write.py) that writes to the standard error and exits with a specific status code.

Compile: A Python script (101-compile) for compiling Python scripts.
